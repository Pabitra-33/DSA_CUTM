I have been doing my training on Data Structure and Algorithm At GeeksforGeeks. As practice is more important in the journey to be more profiecient and learn effectively, that is why i code the pracice questions and pushing them all in my repsitories for further needs and overview. 
Practiced questions i am completing by learning and practicing the Data Structure and Algorithm to develop my logic building and skills and to aquire more knowledge to give my level best on something.
